Deploying the Project on AWS
Clone this project in the remote VM:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/hassanhah/AWS-Session-.git
Set up the following environment variables in a .env file:
plaintext
Copy code
DOMAIN="http://18.232.138.141"

For this project, we'll need to set up an Elastic IP Address for our EC2, and that will be our DOMAIN.

Initialize and start the project:
arduino
Copy code
npm install
npm run start
NOTE: We need to edit the inbound rules in the security group of our EC2 to allow traffic from our particular port.

Project is Deployed on AWS ðŸŽ‰
